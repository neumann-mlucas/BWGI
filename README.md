### Programming Challenges

Below are three programming challenges. The solutions must be implemented in
Python 3 and will be executed in an environment containing only the language's
standard libraries. This environment will result from executing the following
commands:

```bash
conda create -y -n myenv python=3.9
conda activate myenv
```

The statements below are shortened versions of problems that the BWGI
Technology team encountered in the last year. All solutions will be evaluated
both from a functional standpoint, with automated tests, and from the
perspective of the quality of the produced source code (clarity, efficiency,
complexity, etc.).
